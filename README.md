# emailer
Email code that I often use but don't want to lose.  

Code has been refactored from a stand-alone script into a python module
for re-use.  In fact, it has been reused in the ping_tracer tool (not on
github for now).

```bash
python3 transporter.py from_email.gmail.com to_email@gmail.com password What image1.png image2.png
```
